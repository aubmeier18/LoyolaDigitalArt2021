# My abs fav sketch .... so far
I spent hours and hours lost in the wealth of amazing work done by so many Processing users. My favorite was
[210509 Marking Life by Che-Yu Wu](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1189493)

## What I responded to
I really enjoyed the build up of texture and color by overlaying different images, shapes, and text.  It is ok to like more things. and write about them here. It is even ok question aesthetic or coding decisions.

## What I would like to learn from this piece
I would like to learn how to place random visual elements in random locations on the pixel grid. Perhaps even more. And so on...
